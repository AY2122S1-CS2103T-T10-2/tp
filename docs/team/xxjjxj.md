### Project: Managera

Managera is a desktop event organizing application adapted from AddressBook - Level 3. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added ability to filter events by date and optionally time.
    * What it does: Allow users to filter for events occurring on a specific date and optionally time.
    * Justification: When there are many events on Managera, it is hard to eyeball for events that occurs on a specific day.
