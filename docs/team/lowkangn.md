### Project: AddressBook Level 3

Managera is a desktop app that provides event organisers with a convenient method of keeping track of upcoming events 
and the details of their participants. It does not handle communication between the event organiser and the participants.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `Mark an Event as Done`
    * What it does: Allows users to mark a specific event as done, implying that it has concluded or passed.
    * Justification: After an event has passed, users may want to mark it as done so that they can be certain that 
      the event was conducted and concluded.

* **New Feature**: `View a Participant's details`
    * What it does: Allows users to view the detailed information of a participant in the list, including the list of 
      events the participant is attending.
    * Justification: After many events and participants have been added to Managera, users may want to recall which 
    events a certain participant is enrolled in to make plans for their upcoming schedules.
