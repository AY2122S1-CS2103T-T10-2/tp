### Project: Managera

Managera - a desktop app that provides event organisers with a convenient method of keeping track of upcoming events and 
the details of their participants and collaborators. It does not handle communication between the event organiser and 
the participants or collaborators.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added ability to display the details of an Event.
    * What it does: Allow users to obtain all the details of a desired Event.
    * Justification: Users will often need to check the specific date and time of individual Events, especially if they are keeping track of many Events and can't remember the details offhand.

* **New Feature**: Added ability to display the list of Participants of an Event.
    * What it does: Allow users to obtain a list of all the Participants of a desired Event.
    * Justification: Users will often need to obtain a list of Participants for individual Events (e.g. nominal roll for printing purposes, or to check the number of Participants), especially if they are keeping track of many Events and can't remember all the Participants for an Event offhand.
