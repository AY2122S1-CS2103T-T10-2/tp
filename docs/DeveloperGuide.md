## **Introduction**

Managera is a desktop application for managing your event details and its corresponding participant credentials. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Managera Product Website](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-t10-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html)**.

### Architecture

<img src="images/DG images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/DC images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/DC images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/DG images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ParticipantListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Participant` or `Event` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/DC images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/UG screenshots/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/DC images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![ModelClassDiagram](images/DG images/ModelClassDiagram.png)


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Participant` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueParticipantList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Participant` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Participant>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Participant` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Participant` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/DG images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/DC images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Event feature

This feature allows Managera users to create an event at the specified date and time.

#### Implementation Details

The `AddressBookParser` is responsible for determining the type of `Command` to be created from user input,
we can simply add a new `commandType` case for `AddEventCommand` in `AddressBookParser`. 

The `AddEventCommandParser` reads the user's input and passes it to `ParserUtil` to ensure that the event's name, 
date and time are valid. Then, an Event is created with the returned `EventName`, `EventDate` and `EventTime` objects. 
This event will be supplied to the `addEventCommand` to be executed.

Since Managera employs a UniqueEventList, it should not have more than one Event with the same name. The `addressBook` 
will check if the given event already exists. If not, it will be successfully added to the `addressBook` through the model.

#### Implementation Rationale

As events may span a full day, we decided to implement time as an optional attribute of the Event. However, to accommodate
this, Event is implemented with abstractions EventName, EventDate and EventTime. These abstractions are helpful in ensuring
reliability of the program.


### Remove Event feature

This feature allows Managera users to remove an existing event at a particular index of the displayed list.

#### Implementation Details

The `AddressBookParser` is responsible for determining the type of `Command` to be created from user input,
we can simply add a new `commandType` case for `RemoveEventCommand` in `AddressBookParser`.

The `RemoveEventCommandParser` reads the user's input and passes it to `ParserUtil` which returns an `Index`. This 
`Index` will be supplied to the `removeEventCommand` to be executed. 

When the command is executed, there is a check to ensure the index is within the range of the displayed list. 

#### Design Considerations:
##### Aspect: Specifying Event to be Removed: 

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Remove by Index:
    * Pros:
        1. The index of the event in the currently displayed list can be directly used.
        2. Faster and more intuitive for users.
    * Cons:
        1. The index is independent of the Event, which may lead to an inconsistent user experience. 

* **Alternative 2**: Remove by Event ID:
    * Pros:
        1. Every Event will have a unique ID, leading to a consistent user experience. 
    * Cons:
        1. The IDs will not be displayed in sequential order and may approach large numbers, which becomes less user-friendly.
         
* **Alternative 3**: Remove by Event Name:
    * Pros:
        1. User can be more sure of the event they are removing, since it is referencing the Event name.
    * Cons:
        1. The user has to fully match the Event name, which is much more cumbersome. 

### Filter Event feature

This feature allows Managera users to filter the event list by date of event and by time.

#### Implementation Details

The `AddressBookParser` is responsible for determining the type of `Command` to be created from user input, 
we can simply add a new `commandType` case for `FilterEventCommand` in `AddressBookParser`. 

Since this feature requires Managera to take in user input and determine if the filter is by:

1. Date only, or
2. Date and Time

A `FilterEventCommandParser` is made to be responsible for this purpose. The `FilterEventCommandParser` parses user's 
input and creates the `EventDateTimePredicate` which the `FilterEventCommand` will use to execute the filtering.
`EventDateTimePredicate` implements `Predicate<Event>` which can be passed to a `FilteredList<Event>` to filter the 
event list. 

The `FilterEventCommand` created by `FilterEventCommandParser` will contain the `EventDateTimePredicate` to filter the 
event list. When the command is executed, the `model` will filter the `FilteredList<Event>` using the 
`EventDateTimePredicate` and display only events that fulfils the `EventDateTimePredicate` contained in 
`FilterEventCommand`.


#### Implementation Rationale

With considerations to how the `Event` class is implemented, some events do not have time associated to them.
We feel that since all `Event` objects have a date associated through the `EventDate` class, filtering should be done primarily 
through date i.e. `EventDate`. However, understanding that users might want to filter by time too, it is included as an 
optional criteria for filtering.


#### Design Considerations:
##### Aspect: Criteria to filter by:

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: By date and optionally time:
  * Pros: 
    1. Filtering by "date only" allows users to see both events with or without time on the specific date.
    2. Greater flexibility on how specific users want to filter the event list by.
  * Cons:
    1. Unable to filter for only events that do not have time associated.


* **Alternative 2**: By Date and Time: (both fields compulsory)
  * Pros:
    1. Able to filter for only events that do not have time on a specific date.
  * Cons:
    1. Unable to get a more general filter for events occurring on a specific date.
    2. Compulsory time field is too specific and the number of events displayed for a filter attempt might be too low. 

##### Aspect: With or without prefix:

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: With prefixes:
  * Pros:
    1. Sequence of parameters can be randomized, more flexible command syntax.
    2. Clear to user which field is being keyed in.
    3. Easy to implement with support of existing classes.
  * Cons:
    1. This adds up to the number of prefixes already present in Managera which may be hard for users to remember.


* **Alternative 2**: Without prefix:
  * Pros:
    1. Clean and slightly shorter command syntax.
    2. Less prefix to remember.
  * Cons:
    1. Rigid command syntax.
    2. Requires more comprehensive implementation to deal with user input (E.g. Date Only or Date and Time)

The following is the sequence diagram for how a `FilterEventCommand` works internally.

![FilterEventSequenceDiagram](images/DG images/FilterEventSequenceDiagram.png)

### View Participant's Details feature

This feature allows Managera users to look for a specific participant and view their details. The search is done using
the participant's ID since each participant has a unique ID.

#### Implementation Details

The `AddressBookParser` is responsible for determining the type of `Command` to be created from user input,
we can simply add a new `commandType` case for `ViewCommand` in `AddressBookParser`.

A `ViewCommandParser` parses the user's input and creates the `ParticipantIdMatchesGivenIdPredicate` which the 
`ViewCommand` will use to search for the participant. `ParticipantIdMatchesGivenIdPredicate` implements 
`Predicate<Participant>` which can be passed to a `FilteredList<Participant>` to filter out the participant. Since the
predicate searches for the exact match, it would return only one result in the filtered list.

The `ViewCommand` created by `ViewCommandParser` will contain the `ParticipantIdMatchesGivenIdPredicate` to filter
the participant list. When the command is executed, the `model` will filter the `FilteredList<Participant>` using
the `ParticipantIdMatchesGivenIdPredicate` and display the participant that fulfils the 
`ParticipantIdMatchesGivenIdPredicate` contained in `ViewCommand`.

#### Implementation Rationale

Since each participant has a unique ID, it provides a convenient way for the user to look for a specific participant if
matching ID is used as the criterion. The `findParticipant` command provides similar functionality, but returns a list 
of participants instead because it uses names, which are more imprecise. Hence, a separate command was decidedly
implemented to allow users the ability to sieve out a single participant for a more detailed view.

#### Design Considerations:
##### Aspect: Similar participant IDs:

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Exact match:
    * Pros:
        1. The details of the specific participant are returned immediately, provided that the user's input is an exact
           match of the participant's ID.
        2. Simpler implementation, simpler for the participant to use.
    * Cons:
        1. The user has to know the exact ID of the participant otherwise the wrong participant may be found.


* **Alternative 2**: Find similar IDs:
    * Pros:
        1. A list of participants that contain the user's input in their IDs are returned, offering greater flexibility 
        if the user does not fully recall the exact ID of the participant they are looking for. The search can be 
           further refined by subsequent user input to narrow it down to the specific participant.
    * Cons:
        1. Significantly harder implementation.

The following is the sequence diagram for how a `ViewCommand` works internally.

![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/DG images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![ViewCommandActivityDiagram](images/DG images/ViewCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### Add/Remove Participant to/from event - enroll/expel

This feature allows Managera users to quickly add/remove Participant to/from event according to the current filtered
 list of events and Participant visible to user.

#### Implementation Details

The `AddressBookParser` is responsible for determining the type of `Command` to be created from user input, 
hence we add new `commandType` cases for `AddParticipantToEventCommand` and `RemoveParticipantFromEventCommand` in `AddressBookParser`

A `AddParticipantToEventParser` parses the user's input and obtain indexes for Participant and Event respectively. 
If the indexes given by the user are not zero-based indexes, a `ParseException` will be thrown before `AddParticipantToEventParser` creates the command itself to prevent any further error. 
If all indexes are valid, a `AddParticipantToEventCommand` will be created by the parser.

The `AddParticipantToEventCommand` created by `AddParticipantToEventParser` contains 2 zero-based indexes. 
The first one is used to identify the `Participant` while the second is used to identify the `Event`. 
When the command is executed, the `model` first tries to obtain Participant at specified index (if unsuccessful, a `CommandException` will be thrown accordingly) and then event will be retrieved in the same manner (if unsuccessful, a `CommmandException` will be thrown accordingly). If the Event does not already contain the `Participant` object, the Participant will be added to the event accordingly.
 Otherwise, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

A `RemoveParticipantFromEventParser` parses the user's input and obtain indexes for Participant and Event respectively. 
The workflow is nearly identical to `AddParticipantToEvent`. It is only that instead of throwing `CommandException` if `Participant` object already exists in the event,
the `CommandException` will be thrown when `Participant` *doesn't* exist in the event. After all of that, the `Participant` object will be removed from the `Event`. 


#### Implementation Rationale

Since the command implies that the index of Participant should come before event, there is no need for prefixes to be used as that would incur extra typing for the user and slow down the process.

The following activity diagrams summarise what happens when a user executes a new command in each case:

`AddParticipantToEvent` - `enroll`

![AddParticipantToEventActivityDiagram](images/DG images/AddParticipantToEventByIndexActivityDiagram.png)

`RemoveParticipantFromEvent` - `expel`

![RemoveParticipantFromEventActivityDiagram](images/DG images/RemoveParticipantByIndexActivityDiagram.png)

The command keywords to add/remove participant to/from events are `enroll` and `expel`
respectively as many have found `addParticipant` and `removeParticipant` to be too long for the commands that are used 
regularly and the main core of the application.

### View Event Details feature

This feature allows Managera users to find an Event by name and view its details. The search is done using the Event's 
name since Managera employs a UniqueEventList and will not have more than one Event with a given name.

#### Implementation Details

The `AddressBookParser` is responsible for determining the type of `Command` to be created from user input, hence we 
simply added a new `commandType` case for `ShowEventDetailsCommand` in `AddressBookParser`.

A `ShowEventDetailsCommandParser` parses the user's input and creates an `EventNamePredicate` which the
`ShowEventDetailsCommand` uses to search for the Event. `EventNamePredicate` implements `Predicate<Event>` which 
can be passed to a `FilteredList<Event>` to filter out the Event. Since the predicate searches for the Event with a name
that matches the predicate exactly, it returns only one result in the filtered list.

The `ShowEventDetailsCommand` created by `ShowEventDetailsParser` contains the `EventNamePredicate` used to filter the 
Event list. When the command is executed, the `model` obtains the Event by filtering the `FilteredList<Event>` using 
the `EventNamePredicate` and displays its details.

#### Implementation Rationale

Since each Event has a unique name, it provides a convenient way for the user to look for a specific Event if matching 
name is used as the criterion. 

Another command similar in function is `findEvent`, where the model will filter the existing Event list and display the 
Events with names that contain a given keyword. However, this implementation is meant for returning a list of possibly 
multiple Events. Since we are only looking for one particular Event, we decided that instead of filtering the Event list 
to display just the one Event, we leave the Event list untouched and simply return the Event details to the results 
display.

#### Design Considerations:
##### Aspect: Similar Event names:

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Exact name match:
    * Pros:
        1. The details of the specific Event are returned immediately, provided that the user's input is an exact
           match of the Event's name.
        2. Simpler to implement.
    * Cons:
        1. The user has to know the exact name of the Event, otherwise no Event, or the wrong Event, may be found.
        2. If the Event name is long, typographical errors are likely, resulting in the desired Event not being found.


* **Alternative 2**: Find similar names, or by a given keyword:
    * Pros:
        1. A list of Events with names that contain the user's input are returned, offering greater flexibility
           if the user does not fully recall the entire name of the Event they are looking for. The search can be
           further refined by subsequent user input to narrow it down to the specific Event.
    * Cons:
        1. Significantly harder implementation.

The following is the sequence diagram for how a `ShowEventDetailsCommand` works internally.

![ShowEventDetailsSequenceDiagram](images/DG images/ShowEventDetailsSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new command:

![ShowEventDetailsActivityDiagram](images/DG images/ShowEventDetailsActivityDiagram.png)

### \[Proposed\] Undone Event feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undone event feature is an add-on command to the current implementation of Managera. Since
the `AddressBookParser` is responsible for determining the type of `Command` to be created from user input,
a new `commandType` case for `UndoneEventCommand` is required in `AddressBookParser`.

An `UndoneEventCommandParser` is needed to parse the user's input and creates an `Index` representing the position of
the event in the Event list. The `UndoneEventCommand` created by `UndoneEventCommandParser` will contain the `Index`
of the event in the displayed Event list to be undone. When the command is executed, the `model` will retrieve the event at the specified
`Index` and change the completion status of the Event object.

### \[Proposed\] Enroll and Expel multiple Participants from multiple events

#### Proposed Implementation

The current implementation of `AddParticipantToEventCommand`(enroll) and `RemoveParticipantFromEventCommand`(expel)
only allows the enrolling/expelling of a single Participant to/from a single Event. To extend this feature to:

1. Enroll/Expel a Participant to/from multiple Events.
2. Enroll/Expel multiple Participants to/from an Event.
3. Enroll/Expel multiple Participants to/from multiple Events.

It is recommended to incorporate the use of the `Prefix` class in these commands. Instead of the current syntax of
`enroll PARTICIPANT_INDEX EVENT_INDEX` and `expel PARTICPANT_INDEX EVENT_INDEX`. A change to 
`enroll pid/PARTICIPANT_INDEXES... eid/EVENT_INDEXES...` and `expel pid/PARTICIPANT_INDEXES... eid/EVENT_INDEXES...`
allows these cases to be possible. The `model` will then remove each of the specified Participants from each of the
specified Events.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 Participants without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage. 
3.  Should be able to hold up to 100 events without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
4.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
5.  Should work without having to use an installer or compiler.
6.  Should work without requiring an internet connection.
7.  Saved data should be kept in a single file to allow for easy transfer to a different device.
8.  The system should respond within two seconds.


### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X. <br>
* **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: A CLI is a text-based interface that processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text.<br>
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A GUI is a form of user interface through which users interact with electronic devices via visual indicator representations.<br>
* **API**: The Application Programming Interface specifies the interface through which software and other programs interact.<br>
* **Main Success Scenario (MSS)**: The most straightforward interaction for a given use case, which assumes that nothing goes wrong.<br>
* **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation, is a common file format which stores data in key-value pairs and arrays.<br>
* **Participant**: A person that is participating in or attending some given event.<br>
* **Event**: An event that will be conducted in real life e.g., a competition, meeting, social activity etc.<br>
* **Command**: A command is a specific instruction that you give to Managera to perform a certain action, like adding a 
  new Participant to the list. Commands will be the primary way that you will interact with Managera.<br>
* **Parameter**: Parameters are pieces of data that must be passed to certain commands to tell Managera which actions to
  perform. For example, the `done` command requires a single integer as a parameter so that it knows which event to mark
  as done.<br>
* **Prefix**: Prefixes are unique identifiers in front of parameters so that Managera understands what kind of values
  they are. For example, the prefix "n/" lets Managera know that a name is expected to follow behind it, while the
  prefix "d/" lets Managera know that a date is expected.<br>
