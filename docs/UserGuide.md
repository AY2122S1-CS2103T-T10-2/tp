Managera is a **desktop app that provides event organisers with a convenient method of keeping track of upcoming 
[events](#glossary) and the details of their [participants](#glossary)**. It does not handle communication between the event organiser and the 
participants.

Managera is OS-independent meaning it will work on any operating system. (Windows, MacOS, Linux)

## Quick start

1. [Ensure](https://twallet.telangana.gov.in/TABiometric/data/Java%20Check.pdf) you have Java `11` or 
   above installed in your Computer.

2. If your computer does not have Java `11`, obtain the installation package from 
   [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11) and follow the instructions 
   [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html).

3. Download the latest release `managera.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/releases).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the [parameters](#glossary) to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addEvent n/NAME d/DATE`, `n/NAME` and `d/DATE` are parameters which can be used as 
  `addEvent n/CS2103T Final d/2021-11-23`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `addEvent n/NAME d/DATE [t/TIME]` can be used as `addEvent n/CS2103T Final d/2021-11-23 t/1700` or as 
  `addEvent n/CS2103T Final d/2021-11-23`.

* Parameters with [prefixes](#glossary) can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME d/DATE`, `d/DATE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Parameters without prefixes needs to be followed strictly.<br>
  e.g. `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [d/BIRTHDATE]` INDEX must strictly be the first parameter 
  while the others with prefix can be in any order after that.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of 
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `t/1700 t/1800`, only `t/1800` will be taken.

* If a command does not take in any parameters, (namely `help`, `list`, `clear`, `sortEvents` and 
  `exit`) then any extra words added after the command will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `sortEvents 123`, it will be interpreted as `sortEvents`.

## Glossary

**Participant**: A person that is participating in or attending some given event.<br>

**Event**: An event that will be conducted in real life e.g., a competition, meeting, social activity etc.<br>

**Command**: A command is a specific instruction that you give to Managera to perform a certain action, like adding a 
new Participant to the list. Commands will be the primary way that you will interact with Managera.<br>

**Parameter**: Parameters are pieces of data that must be passed to certain commands to tell Managera which actions to 
perform. For example, the `done` command requires a single integer as a parameter so that it knows which event to mark 
as done.<br>

**Prefix**: Prefixes are unique identifiers in front of parameters so that Managera understands what kind of values 
they are. For example, the prefix "n/" lets Managera know that a name is expected to follow behind it, while the 
prefix "d/" lets Managera know that a date is expected.<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install and run Managera in the other computer. Then overwrite the empty save file it creates with the save file 
from your previous computer. The save file of Managera is found in `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.

**Q**: Does Managera have a mobile version?<br>
**A**: Managera currently does not operate on any other platform other than desktop.

**Q**: I accidentally exited Managera by closing the window rather than using the given `exit` command, what do I 
do?<br>
**A**: Since Managera automatically saves your data to the hard disk after each change, it should not reverse any 
changes you have made in the session. Your progress is most likely preserved after restarting Managera.
