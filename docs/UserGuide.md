## Quick start

1. [Ensure](https://twallet.telangana.gov.in/TABiometric/data/Java%20Check.pdf) you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. If your Computer do not have Java `11`, obtain the installation package from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11) and follow the instructions [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html).

3. Download the latest `managera.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/releases).

4. Copy the Managera.jar to a new folder and that will be the _home folder_ for Managera.

5. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all Participants.

   * **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a Participant named `John Doe` to Managera.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addEvent n/NAME d/DATE`, `n/NAME` and `d/DATE` are parameters which can be used as `addEvent n/CS2103T Final d/2021-11-23`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `addEvent n/NAME d/DATE [t/TIME]` can be used as `addEvent n/CS2103T Final d/2021-11-23 t/1700` or as `addEvent n/CS2103T Final d/2021-11-23`.

* Parameters with prefixes can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME d/DATE`, `d/DATE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Parameters without prefixes needs to be followed strictly.<br>
  e.g. `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [d/BIRTHDATE]` INDEX must strictly be the first parameter while the others with prefix can be in any order after that.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `t/1700 t/1800`, only `t/1800` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (namely `help`, `list`, `clear`, `sortEvents` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `sortEvents 123`, it will be interpreted as `sortEvents`.
